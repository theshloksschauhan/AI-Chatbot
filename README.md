🧠 Problem Statement 12: Agentic AI for Personalized Course Pathways

📘 Overview

This project implements an Agentic AI system that dynamically recommends personalized learning pathways based on a learner's goals, current skill level, and preferences. The goal is to empower students and lifelong learners to navigate educational content effectively using an intelligent, autonomous agent that adapts to their evolving needs.


---

🚀 Objective

To design and build an AI agent capable of:

Understanding a user’s learning goals and background

Mapping suitable courses, tutorials, and resources

Recommending optimized and evolving learning paths

Tracking progress and adjusting recommendations in real-time



---

💡 Key Features

✅ Multi-agent system that handles goal setting, path planning, feedback adaptation

🎯 Goal-driven personalization using NLP and user profiling

🗺️ Dynamic curriculum planning with progress tracking

🤖 Explainable AI suggestions with rationale behind each course/resource

📊 Visual representation of learning progress and future trajectory



---

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React / Flutter / Streamlit (for prototype UI)

Backend: Python, FastAPI

AI/ML:

LLMs (GPT or open-source)

Skill Graph and Knowledge Modeling

Reinforcement Learning for path optimization


Database: PostgreSQL / Firebase / Neo4j (for skill graph)

Hosting: Render / Vercel / HuggingFace Spaces



---

🔍 Use Case Scenario

User: A second-year engineering student who wants to become a Data Scientist.

Process:

1. User logs in and sets the goal: Become a Data Scientist in 6 months


2. Agent assesses current skills (via quiz, resume, LinkedIn, etc.)


3. AI recommends a pathway across different topics (Python → Statistics → ML → DL)


4. Learner gets resources (YouTube, Coursera, blogs, GitHub projects)


5. System tracks completion, asks feedback, and readjusts plan weekly




---

🧩 System Modules

UserProfiler: Builds and updates learner profile

GoalInterpreter: Maps abstract goals to skills

PathwayPlanner: Uses knowledge graphs to build course sequences

ResourceRecommender: Picks resources based on learning style

ProgressMonitor: Tracks activity, recommends changes

FeedbackLoop: Refines learning path via reinforcement



---

🧪 Example Input & Output

Input:

{
  "goal": "Become a full-stack web developer",
  "background": "Familiar with Python and basic HTML",
  "preferences": ["project-based learning", "free resources"]
}

Output:

Roadmap (HTML → CSS → JS → React → Node.js → MongoDB)

Suggested Resources: [freeCodeCamp], [The Odin Project], YouTube playlists

Estimated time: 4 months (flexible)

Weekly learning targets and assessment suggestions



---

🧭 Future Scope

Integration with LMS platforms (Moodle, Google Classroom)

Adaptive testing to assess concept mastery

Chatbot-based query resolution

Community learning agent for peer-suggested pathways

Multilingual agent support
